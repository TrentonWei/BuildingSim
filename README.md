The Code is developed to support the findings of our submitted paper entitled “基于DNA序列比对的多直角建筑物图形形状相似性计算方法-Shape similarity measurement based on DNA alignment for buildings with multiple orthogonal features"

The tools were implemented in C# on ArcGIS 10.2 software (ESRI, USA), the tool has a separate form to set the input, output and parameters for the algorithm.
